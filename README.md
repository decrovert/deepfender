# Deepfender
Deepfender is a tower-defense RTS (real-time strategy) game
which takes place in the depths of the ocean,
where one places towers and similar structures
by using the general health state of the planet as an energy source
in order to defend from hostile deep-sea creatures attacking them.

It was made in three days (or 72 hours)
for [Mini Jam 109: Depth(s)](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-109-depths),
using [the Unity game engine](https://unity.com/).
Just like the code,
all the 2D art was conceived during the development period,
as well as the idea for the game and its mechanics.

The game is available for [Microsoft Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows).
It is hosted on the [Itch.io page](https://decrovert.itch.io/deepfender).
